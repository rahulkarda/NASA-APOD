## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. <s>Tackling video integration</s> 
   2. <s>Handling HTTP Error 400/404</s>
   3. Implement more APIs and provide more options for the user
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to integrate a API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create a simple API based project. I learned about API management and how the API serves a request and how can it help in improving businesses.
